# traefik-crowdsec
This is a template to deploy a Traefik proxy protected by crowdsec. It includes Prometheus and Grafana to collect and display a variety of information of your Traefik and Crowdsec containers.

I've mainly chosen Grafana because of all the community-made dashboards for all kinds of services to help you monitor and observe your important containers.
